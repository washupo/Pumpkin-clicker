<!-- # Instructions
To improve our JavaScript skills, we have 5 days to create a cookie clicker game as a team. 
- [Instructions links](https://github.com/becodeorg/Swartz-8/blob/main/2.The-Hill/1.Javascript/cookieClicker.md)-->

# Languages and frameworks used 
- HTML5, CSS3
- Javascript 
- Vite

# Wireframe - First draft
We want to make a minimalist yet beautiful layout inspired by the [original game](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) to offer a user-friendly design experience. 

We wanted to simplify the layout with the cookie button and the point on one side, and all the features on the other, so we can have a clear view and not to much information.


Of course, we choose colors that remind us of a cookie and we will try to find fonts and animation that suit that theme.

# Developement instructions
## Cloning the Repository

1. Navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like:
    `cd`: to change your working directory.
    `cd ../` to "go back" a level in your directory tree.
2. Clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:

    `git clone git@github.com:yvessoham/Javascript.git`

3. Now you can see the contents of the remote repository on your machine by moving into the newly cloned directory:

    `cd Javascript/`
    `ls -la`

## Updating Your Local Repository

When changes are made to the remote repository, they will not automatically sync with your local copy. You can update your local directory by running the following command when your working directory is `Javascript`. You can check your working directory by running pwd, the last item in the path should be `Javascript/`.

To update your local git directory:
-git pull

**Note:** on `git pull` errors: You may get a `git pull` error if you have made changes to files in your local git directory. This is ok, and normal. If you get an error when you `pull` (or update) the repo that says something like "Your local changes to the following files will be overwritten by mergeâ€™", you can do a `git stash` to address this. To find out how to do this, go to https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing to read all about it.

## Updating Your Local Changes To The Remote Repository

1. `git status` 
    Always a good idea, this command shows you what branch you're on, what files are in the working or staging directory, and any other important information.
2. `git checkout [branch-name]`
    Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory.
3. `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
    Records file snapshots permanently in version history.
4. `git push` 
    Uploads all local branch commits to the remote.
